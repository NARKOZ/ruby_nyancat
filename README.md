# Ruby port of Nyancat CLI

A Ruby port of the original nyancat CLI by [Kevin Lange](https://github.com/klange/nyancat). Currently only supports xterm 256-color compatible terminals, likely doesn't work on Windows and lacks any finese or optimisation.

    $ gem install nyancat
    $ nyancat

## Audio 

Very basic audio support is provided by using [mpg123](http://www.mpg123.de/). You'll need mpg123 installed and in your $PATH for audio to work.
